* [PostgreSQL 9.4 - What I was hoping for](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2014/02/15/PostgreSQL-9.4-What-I-Wanted/) - HStore 2 would actually be useful
* [Compiling in the background for a smoother user experience](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/02/compiling-in-background-for-smoother.html?m=1) - sound great, so does the new profiling visualization tool
* [Don't Repeat your Mistakes: Conducting Post-mortems](http://blog.pusher.com/dont-repeat-your-mistakes-conducting-post-mortems/) - really good to have a formal process for this
* [3 User experience improving JavaScript libraries you should know about](http://creative-punch.net/2014/02/3-user-experience-improving-javascript-libraries-know/#) - Drop.js seems quite nice.
* [Good engineering managers aren't just hard to find - they don't exist](http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/13/good-engineering-managers-arent-just-hard-to-find-they-dont-exit/) - "people who want the engineering manager role are unlikely to be very good at it; and those who could be good at it donâ€™t want anything to do with it at all"

I've gotten myself into the situation where I have been bookmarking lots of seemingly interesting articles, blogs, repos etc... and not actually following up and looking at them. Probably because I think I don't have the time. Which is a big fat lie.

So to break the cycle, I'm going to regularly publish short lists of my bookmarks that are actually of interest to me - I'll know this because I will have looked them. (I've been doing this for a short while to see if I'd actually do it.)

I'll probably blog occasionally too.

Hopefully there may be some stuff of interest in here for you too.
